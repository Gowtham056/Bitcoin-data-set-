 Based upon the high and low values of the bitcoin value on the particular day compute gross profit or loss of that day - >> gross profit or loss = opening value - closing value of that day . Then draw a simple plot in between the date ( on x axis ) and gross profit or loss of that day (on y axis ) - Along with the marking the coordinates of that graph also connect all the coordinates .
